# Frontend Web Development Exercise

### Task

Use **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** to code a responsive grid of food items that matches the included design. The page should initially display the entire selection of items and offer the possibility to filter the list by categories. Ensure a positive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

### Tools

You may use any tools at your disposal to solve the exercise, but please avoid overly complex boilerplates.

If running your solution requires the use of any command line tools, include a `dist` folder of precompiled files. It should be possible to view your solution by simply opening an HTML file in a browser without first having to install anything.

### Handover

Upload your finished code to a public repository such as GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab and submit the link to us within three business days of receiving this briefing. Ideally, solving the exercise will not require more than four hours of your time.

Have fun and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions!
